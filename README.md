# My Fast.AI Journey

## Goal
Master deep learning through the fast.ai course and build meaningful AI projects for prosthetics and materials science.

## Projects
- [x] Bird Classifier (Chapter 1) – Day 2 guided, Day 3 solo
- [x] Bear Classifier (3-category classification)
- [ ] Prosthetic Device Classifier (breakthrough project)
- [ ] BNNT Quality Control (materials science application)

## Progress
- Day 1: Started course
- Day 2: Completed guided bird classifier
- Day 3: Solo rebuild, started bear classifier, GitHub setup
- Day 4: Built complete prosthetic classifier pipeline
- Day 5: Finalized and committed prosthetic classifier code

## Tech Stack
- fast.ai and PyTorch
- Kaggle (Chapters 1–3)
- Linux setup (Chapter 4+)
- Python for Data Analysis

## Directory Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks from course
- `projects/` – Individual project folders
- `data/` – Datasets (gitignored)
- `models/` – Trained models (gitignored)
- `docs/` – Documentation and guides
