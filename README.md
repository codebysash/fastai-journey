# My Fast.AI Journey

## Goal
Master deep learning through fast.ai course and build meaningful AI projects for prosthetics and materials science.

## Projects
- [x] Bird Classifier (Chapter 1) - Day 2 guided, Day 3 solo
- [ ] Bear Classifier (3-category classification)  
- [ ] Prosthetic Device Classifier (breakthrough project)
- [ ] BNNT Quality Control (materials science application)

## Progress
- Day 1: Started course
- Day 2: Completed guided bird classifier  
- Day 3: Solo rebuild + bear classifier + GitHub setup

## Tech Stack
- Fast.ai & PyTorch
- Kaggle (Chapters 1-3)
- Linux setup (Chapter 4+)
- Python for Data Analysis

## Directory Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks from course
- `projects/` - Individual project folders
- `data/` - Datasets (gitignored)
- `models/` - Trained models (gitignored)
- `docs/` - Documentation and guides
