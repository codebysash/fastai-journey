# Bird Classifier - Version 1

## Overview
My first image classifier built during Day 3 of fast.ai journey. Classifies images as "bird" or "forest" using transfer learning with ResNet18.

## Results
- **Accuracy:** ~94%
- **Training time:** 3 epochs (~3 seconds)
- **Model:** ResNet18 fine-tuned

## Key Learnings
- Data collection with DuckDuckGo search
- Data organization and cleaning
- Transfer learning concepts
- DataLoaders and DataBlocks

## Files
- `bird-classifier-v1.ipynb` - Complete training notebook
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
- Build bear classifier (3 categories)
- Apply to prosthetic device classification
